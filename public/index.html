We aim to give players more freedom, allowing them to decide their fate, storyline, have some effect on the world and have the world react to their actions. We do not want players to feel bogged down by rules and feel restricted. No more invisible walls or props/text telling you that you can't go somewhere. The players are now the ones writing the story, not the Staff. You create, you decide, you enjoy yourself."

However, we can tell you now that we are doing our very best to make sure the citizen faction is very much involved in all aspects of the City and its functionality, meaning their RP will be increased. We will also be making sure that citizens can have fun and gain the chance to play games with other citizens, chat with other factions and interact other than Resistance/Refugees and much much more!"
